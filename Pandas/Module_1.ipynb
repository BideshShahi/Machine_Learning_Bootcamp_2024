    "### **1.1 Introduction to Pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Pandas is essential for Data Science, ML, and AI**\n",
    "Pandas is an open-source data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides high-level data structures (Series and DataFrames) and numerous functions that make data cleaning, wrangling, and preprocessing much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key reasons why Pandas is crucial for data science and ML:\n",
    "- **Data manipulation**: Easily filter, group, merge, and reshape datasets.\n",
    "- **Data cleaning**: Pandas simplifies handling missing data, dealing with duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.\n",
    "- **Integration**: Pandas works seamlessly with other data science libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Built on top of NumPy, Pandas is optimized for performance with large datasets.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Installation and Setup**\n",
    "You can install Pandas using `pip` (the package manager for Python). Ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Pandas:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you can start using Pandas by importing it in your Python scripts:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For optimal performance, it's recommended to also have **NumPy** installed:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",

    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Pandas Data Structures**\n",
    "\n",
    "The two core data structures in Pandas are:\n",
    "1. **Series**: A one-dimensional array-like structure that can hold any data type (integers, floats, strings, etc.).\n",
    "2. **DataFrame**: A two-dimensional table with rows and columns, much like an Excel spreadsheet, where each column can have a different data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Series:**\n",
    "A **Series** is like a column in a table, but it comes with labels (indices). It can store any data type: integers, floats, strings, or even Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a Series:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a Series from a list\n",
    "s = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Specifying custom index labels\n",
    "s_custom_index = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=['a', 'b', 'c'])\n",
    "\n",
    "print(s)\n",
    "print(s_custom_index)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties:**\n",
    "- `values`: Returns the values of the Series.\n",
    "- `index`: Returns the index (labels) of the Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(s.values)\n",
    "print(s.index)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **DataFrame:**\n",
    "A **DataFrame** is a 2D table (tabular data) with labeled axes (rows and columns). It is the most commonly used data structure in Pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a DataFrame:**\n",
    "You can create a DataFrame from various inputs like dictionaries, lists, or NumPy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary of lists:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = {\n",
    "    'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],\n",
    "    'Age': [25, 30, 35],\n",
    "    'Salary': [50000, 60000, 70000]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: Creating a DataFrame from a list of dictionaries:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = [\n",
    "    {'Name': 'Alice', 'Age': 25, 'Salary': 50000},\n",
    "    {'Name': 'Bob', 'Age': 30, 'Salary': 60000},\n",
    "    {'Name': 'Charlie', 'Age': 35, 'Salary': 70000}\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties:**\n",
    "- `columns`: Returns the column labels.\n",
    "- `index`: Returns the row labels.\n",
    "- `shape`: Returns the shape (number of rows, number of columns) of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(df.columns)\n",
    "print(df.index)\n",
    "print(df.shape)\n",

    "### **1.3 Basic Operations with Pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Loading Data from Files**\n",
    "Pandas makes it easy to load data from external files, such as CSV, Excel, JSON, and SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading a CSV File:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('file_path.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loading an Excel File:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_excel('file_path.xlsx')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loading a JSON File:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_json('file_path.json')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Basic Inspection of DataFrames**\n",
    "Once the data is loaded, you can inspect it using basic Pandas functions to understand its structure and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`head()`**: Displays the first 5 rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(df.head())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`tail()`**: Displays the last 5 rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(df.tail())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`info()`**: Provides a summary of the DataFrame, including data types and non-null counts.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(df.info())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`describe()`**: Generates descriptive statistics for numeric columns (e.g., count, mean, standard deviation).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(df.describe())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`shape`**: Returns the shape (number of rows, number of columns).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(df.shape)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.4 Indexing and Selecting Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.4.1 Using `[]` Operator:**\n",
    "The `[]` operator can be used to select a single column or a subset of columns from a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select a single column:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age_column = df['Age']\n",
    "print(age_column)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select multiple columns:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "subset = df[['Name', 'Salary']]\n",
    "print(subset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.4.2 Using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`:**\n",
    "1. **`.loc[]`**: Used for label-based indexing. You can select rows and columns by their labels (row/column names).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Select rows by labels\n",
    "row = df.loc[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select rows and columns by labels\n",
    "subset = df.loc[0:2, ['Name', 'Salary']]\n",
    "print(subset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`.iloc[]`**: Used for integer-based indexing. You can select rows and columns by their integer positions (similar to NumPy).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Select rows by index position\n",
    "row = df.iloc[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Select rows and columns by index position\n",
    "subset = df.iloc[0:2, [0, 2]]\n",
    "print(subset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1.4.3 Slicing Data:**\n",
    "- You can slice rows based on their position:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Select rows from index 0 to 3\n",
    "subset = df[0:3]\n",
    "print(subset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slicing is also possible with `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Select rows by labels from 'Name' and 'Age' columns\n",
    "subset = df.loc[0:2, 'Name':'Age']\n",
    "print(subset)\n",
    "```\n",

    "### **1.5 Hands-on Lab**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load a dataset into Pandas and inspect it:**\n",
    "   - Load a CSV file using `pd.read_csv()`.\n",
    "   - Inspect the first few rows using `head()`.\n",
    "   - Check for missing values using `info()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a DataFrame manually:**\n",
    "   - Create a DataFrame from a dictionary.\n",
    "   - Print the DataFrame and its `shape`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indexing and Slicing Practice:**\n",
    "   - Select a single column from the DataFrame.\n",
    "   - Use `.loc[]` to select rows by label and columns by name.\n",
